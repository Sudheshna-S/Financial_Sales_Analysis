# Financial Dashboard ‚Äî Power BI

## üìå Project Overview

This project is an **interactive financial dashboard** built in **Power BI** using the **Financial Sample dataset** provided with Power BI.
The dashboard is designed for **business stakeholders** to track key performance metrics, analyze sales and profit trends, and drill into details for decision-making.

## üéØ Business Problem

Stakeholders often face challenges understanding financial performance across different products, segments, and regions. The dashboard provides:

* **At-a-glance KPIs** (Sales, Profit, Growth, Margin).
* **Time-series analysis** for trends and YoY comparison.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

* **Source**: Financial Sample.xlsx (bundled with Power BI Desktop).
* **Key fields**: Date, Country, Segment, Product, Sales, Profit, COGS, Units Sold.
* **Data modeling**: One fact table (Financials) + one Date table (created with DAX).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Modeling & DAX

* Built a **Date table** using `CALENDARAUTO()` and marked it as a Date table.
* Defined relationships between the Date table and Financials.
* Created core measures in DAX:

  * `Total Sales = SUM(Financials[Sales])`
  * `Total Profit = SUM(Financials[Profit])`
  * `Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)`
  * `Sales LY = CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATEADD('Date'[Date], -1, YEAR))`
  * `YoY Growth % = DIVIDE([Total Sales]-[Sales LY],[Sales LY])`
  * `Sales YTD = TOTALYTD([Total Sales], 'Date'[Date])`
